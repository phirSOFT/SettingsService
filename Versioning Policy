# Versioning Policy

This package uses the following conventions in versioning. Each versiong is of the form `{major}.{minor}.{patch}`.

## Initial version
The first version of the package is `0.1.0`.

## Incrementing
Each merge to the `master` branch increments the `patch` field by one, unless `{minor}` or `{major}` is incremented. In the last case both field `{minor}` and `{patch}` are set to `0`, in the privious one `{patch}``is set to `0`.

## Api stability

* Before version `0.2.0` no api stability is guaranteed.
* Stating at version `0.2.0` all versions with the same `{major}` version are contrentic. That there are no breaking changes in an api once it was introduced. 
* If an commit provides a new api at least the `{minor}` version has to be incremented. 
* Bugfixes, which do not effect the api surface only increment the `{patch}` version
